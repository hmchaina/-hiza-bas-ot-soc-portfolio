# Building Automation, OT Security & SOC Portfolio

This repository documents hands-on technical work across:

- Building Automation Systems (BAS)
- Operational Technology (OT) Security
- Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1–3

The focus is practical troubleshooting, incident response, and cross-domain problem solving rather than theoretical study.

## Core Areas

### Building Automation Systems (BAS)
- VAV and AHU troubleshooting
- Alarm storm root-cause analysis
- Vendor-specific systems:
  - Siemens (Desigo / Apogee)
  - Schneider Electric (EcoStruxure)
  - Johnson Controls (Metasys)
  - Honeywell (Niagara)

### SOC & Cybersecurity
- Tier 1 alert triage and escalation
- Tier 2 correlation and threat hunting
- Tier 3 incident response with OT awareness

### OT Security & Compliance
- Purdue model and network segmentation
- NIST, IEC 62443, ISO 27001 principles
- Safe use of AI for anomaly detection

## Structure
- `/docs` – PDF playbooks and guides
- `/labs` – Hands-on troubleshooting scenarios
- `/interviews` – STAR and technical interview answers
- `/projects` – Case studies and cross-domain work
- `/resume` – Role-targeted resumes

## Philosophy
I approach problems by validating field reality first, correlating data sources, and identifying root causes before taking action—especially in environments where safety and uptime matter.

This portfolio reflects real-world workflows, not lab-only exercises.
